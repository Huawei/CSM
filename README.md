## Description
Container Storage Monitor (CSM) is a tool used for visual display of Huawei storage resources and Kubernetes resources in Kubernetes container scenarios. This tool can notify storage of the relationship between a PV/Pod and a LUN/filesystem so that the relationship can be displayed on the storage for storage administrators to view. It can also upload the performance, capacity, IOPS, and other data of a LUN/file system to a third-party network management system for application administrators to view. In this way, O&M availability in container scenarios can be improved.
